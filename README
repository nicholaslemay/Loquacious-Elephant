This is just a preliminary commit of an idea for a DSL for PHPUnit. 

We needed something simple to write some tests and couldn't find anything to suit our needs.

What we're trying to achieve is a simple syntax for unit test and eventually driving Selenium to do UI testing.

The syntax will be something like

$context = new SeleniumExecutionContext("firefox","http://www.google.com");
$bob = new SeleniumDrivenUser($context);

$bob->logs_in()->andThen()->fills_out(Field::username)->with("bob")->
andThen()->fills_out(Field::password)->with("qwerty")->
andThen()->clicks(Button::login)->andThen()->shouldBeLoggedin();

This type of syntax should hopefully help people who aren't developers understand and write some tests.


As far as UnitTesting is concerned, we are trying to approach it with the BDD philosophy.
Using this PHPUnit Add-On, the testing syntax for expectations now looks like this : 

$nicholas = new TestSubject(new DummyUser("Nicholas",true));
$nicholas->getName()->shouldEqual("Nicholas");

instead of : 

$nicholas = new DummyUser("Nicholas",true);
$this->assertEquals( $nicholas->getName(),"Nicholas");

More to come !
